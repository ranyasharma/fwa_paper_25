\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}

This analysis reveals that throughput is not directly linked to quality of service. 
Fixed wireless networks reveal inconsistent or weak correlations between throughput 
and latency. Starlink, in particular, demonstrates highly variable performance with 
minimal correlation between latency and throughput, indicating that throughput alone 
is an unreliable measure of network quality.

Fixed wireless networks, especially T-Mobile and Verizon, exhibit severe latency fluctuations. 
Both download and upload latency can vary dramatically, with high latency differences 
between ping and actual data transfer. Starlink, while generally stable, still 
shows moderate variability which is a factor to consider. 

These findings indicate that users on fixed wireless networks experience inconsistent performance. 
Even when throughput is high, latency spikes can degrade user experience.
