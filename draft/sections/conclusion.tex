\section{Conclusion and Future Work} \label{sec:conclusion}

Our work underscores that throughput alone is not a reliable indicator of network quality 
for fixed wireless connections. Policymakers should avoid using throughput as the sole metric 
for assessing network quality. Broadband performance evaluations should prioritize latency, 
especially for fixed wireless technologies, where latency can vary significantly even when 
throughput remains high.
